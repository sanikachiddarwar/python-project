## 📘 School Infrastructure Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of school infrastructure across different types of management and categories using a structured dataset. The analysis includes key educational facilities such as electricity, drinking water, toilets, computers, and more.

### 🔍 Objective
To explore and visualize the availability of infrastructure facilities in schools across rural and urban areas, categorized by school management types and levels.

### 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes information about various infrastructure facilities in schools. It is assumed that any facility with a value greater than 0 is considered available.

### 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

### 📊 Key Features
- Cleans and preprocesses the dataset for accurate analysis.
- Calculates overall availability of key infrastructure facilities.
- Compares infrastructure availability:
  - Across school management types (e.g., Government, Private)
  - Across school categories (Primary, Secondary, etc.)
  - Between rural and urban areas
- Identifies schools that are fully equipped with all key facilities.
- Visualizes data using bar charts and pie charts for better understanding.

### 📈 Visualizations Included
- Overall availability of infrastructure facilities
- Facility-wise comparison by school management type
- Facility-wise comparison by school category
- Rural vs Urban infrastructure availability
- Percentage of fully equipped vs under-equipped schools

### ✅ How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure all required libraries are installed (`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`)
3. Place the dataset (`dataset.csv`) in the same folder as the script
4. Run the Python file or Jupyter Notebook to see results
